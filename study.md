# Game Engine Design Study: Object and Property Architecture

This document provides a comparative analysis of the core design philosophies of several popular game engines and frameworks. The focus is on how each approaches the fundamental concepts of game objects, properties, and overall scene structure.

## 1. Unity: The Component-Based Powerhouse

Unity's architecture is a prime example of a pure **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** approach, though it's often described as a **Component-Based** model. This design is intuitive and heavily integrated with its visual editor.

### Core Concepts:
- **`GameObject`**: The fundamental "thing" in a Unity scene. It's essentially an empty container or a "noun" in your game world (e.g., `Player`, `Enemy`, `Bullet`, `LightSource`). A `GameObject` itself has very little dataâ€”primarily its name, tag, and layer. Its real power comes from the components attached to it.
- **`Component`**: These are the "verbs" or properties that give a `GameObject` its behavior and characteristics. A component is a modular piece of functionality. For example:
    - **`Transform`**: Every `GameObject` has one. It stores position, rotation, and scale.
    - **`MeshRenderer`**: Makes the object visible.
    - **`Rigidbody`**: Gives the object physics properties.
    - **Custom Scripts (C#)**: Your game logic (e.g., `PlayerController`, `Health`) is also a component.
- **Scene**: A collection of `GameObjects` that make up a level or a specific screen in your game.

### Property Management:
- **The Inspector**: This is the cornerstone of Unity's workflow. Public fields in your C# scripts (or fields marked with the `[SerializeField]` attribute) are automatically exposed in the Inspector window.
- **Visual Editing**: This allows developers, designers, and artists to tweak properties (like speed, health, color, etc.) without writing any code. This rapid iteration is a major strength.
- **Serialization**: Unity has a powerful, automatic serialization system. When you save a scene or create a **Prefab** (a reusable `GameObject` template), Unity saves the state of all components and their properties.

### Architectural Summary:
- **Philosophy**: Composition over inheritance. You build complex objects by "decorating" a `GameObject` with various components rather than creating deep inheritance hierarchies.
- **Structure**: A "flat" hierarchy of `GameObjects` in a scene, each of which is a collection of components.

## 2. Godot Engine: The Node and Scene Tree System

Godot's design is unique, using a **hierarchical node-based system**. It's elegant and promotes a highly organized, modular structure.

### Core Concepts:
- **`Node`**: Everything in Godot is a node. A node is the smallest building block and is specialized for a specific function (e.g., `Sprite2D`, `Camera3D`, `CharacterBody2D`, `Timer`).
- **Scene Tree**: You build your game by composing these nodes into a tree-like structure. A child node's behavior is relative to its parent (e.g., a `Sprite2D` child of a `CharacterBody2D` will move with it).
- **Scene**: A scene in Godot is simply a tree of nodes, saved to a file. A complete game is often a "tree of scenes," where one main scene might instance other scenes (e.g., loading a level scene or instancing a bullet scene).
- **`Resource`**: While nodes provide behavior, `Resources` are pure data containers. Anything you can save to disk is a resource (e.g., a texture, a script, a material, a font, or even a scene itself). Resources are reference-counted and shared.

### Property Management:
- **The Inspector**: Like Unity, Godot has a powerful Inspector that reflects the properties of the selected node.
- **`@export` Annotation**: To expose a variable from a script (GDScript or C#) to the Inspector, you use the `@export` annotation (or `[Export]` in C#). This is more explicit than Unity's public-by-default approach.
- **Signals**: Godot has a built-in "Observer" pattern called signals. Nodes can emit signals when something happens (e.g., a button is pressed, a timer runs out), and other nodes can connect to these signals to react. This is a key way to decouple objects.

### Architectural Summary:
- **Philosophy**: Build complex objects from simple, specialized nodes. The scene tree defines the relationships between objects.
- **Structure**: A strict parent-child hierarchy. This is more structured than Unity's component-based approach and can feel more organized, especially for UI and 2D games.

## 3. LibGDX: The Unopinionated Java Framework

LibGDX is not a game engine in the same vein as Unity or Godot. It's a **lower-level, code-centric framework**. It provides tools but doesn't enforce a specific architectural pattern.

### Core Concepts:
- **Freedom of Choice**: LibGDX gives you a blank canvas. You get a rendering loop, input handling, audio, and file I/O. How you structure your game objects is entirely up to you.
- **`scene2d` (Optional)**: For 2D games and UI, LibGDX provides an optional scene graph library called `scene2d`.
    - **`Actor`**: The base node in the scene graph. It has properties like position, size, rotation, etc.
    - **`Group`**: An `Actor` that can contain other `Actors`.
    - **`Stage`**: Manages the scene graph, handles drawing, and routes input.
- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: Because of its flexibility, ECS is a very popular architectural pattern for LibGDX developers. Frameworks like **Ashley** are commonly used to implement it.

### Property Management:
- **Purely Code-Driven**: There is no visual editor or Inspector. Object properties are managed entirely through code via standard Java getters and setters.
- **Serialization**: You are responsible for your own serialization. Developers often use libraries like `Json` or `Kryo` to save and load game state.

### Architectural Summary:
- **Philosophy**: Maximum flexibility and control. It's for developers who want to build their own architecture from the ground up.
- **Structure**: Whatever you design. It can be a simple Object-Oriented model, a `scene2d` scene graph, or a full-blown ECS.

## 4. MonoGame: The C# Framework for Purists

MonoGame is very similar to LibGDX in philosophy but uses C# instead of Java. It is the spiritual successor to Microsoft's XNA framework and is even more "unopinionated" than LibGDX.

### Core Concepts:
- **Barebones Framework**: MonoGame provides the absolute essentials: a game loop, a graphics device, and content pipeline for processing assets. It has no built-in concept of a "game object," "scene," or "component."
- **Total Control**: You are expected to write everything. This includes the object model, scene management, physics, and UI system.

### Property Management:
- **Entirely in Code**: Like LibGDX, all object properties are defined and managed in your C# code. There is no editor.
- **Common Patterns**: Developers typically implement their own architecture.
    - **Traditional OOP**: Creating class hierarchies for game objects.
    - **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: This is a very common and recommended pattern for MonoGame projects to manage complexity. Many third-party ECS libraries are available.

### Architectural Summary:
- **Philosophy**: "We give you a canvas and a paintbrush. The rest is up to you." It's for developers who want ultimate control and a deep understanding of the entire game stack.
- **Structure**: Entirely developer-defined.

## 5. Ebitengine (Ebiten): The Minimalist Go Engine

Ebitengine (formerly Ebiten) is a 2D game engine for the Go programming language, built on a philosophy of extreme simplicity.

### Core Concepts:
- **Everything is an Image**: The core design principle. The screen, sprites, and off-screen render targets are all treated as the same type of rectangular image object. All rendering is a matter of drawing one image onto another.
- **The `ebiten.Game` Interface**: The heart of an Ebitengine game. The developer implements this interface, which has three key methods:
    - **`Update()`**: Called at a fixed 60 ticks per second for game logic updates.
    - **`Draw()`**: Called on every frame to render graphics.
    - **`Layout()`**: Defines the logical screen size.
- **Immediate Mode Rendering**: Drawing commands are issued from scratch in the `Draw` function every frame. The engine performs optimizations like automatic batching behind the scenes.

### Property Management:
- **Code-Centric**: All game state and properties are managed directly in Go code. There is no visual editor.
- **Developer-Defined Structure**: Like MonoGame and LibGDX, you define your own object structures. You might use structs to hold entity data and update them within the `Update` function.

### Architectural Summary:
- **Philosophy**: Simplicity and minimalism. Provide the most direct, uncluttered API for 2D game creation.
- **Structure**: A simple, flat structure centered around the `Game` interface. The developer is responsible for all object management.

## 6. Defold: The Component-Based Engine for Collaboration

Defold is a complete, turn-key engine that uses a component-based architecture similar to Unity, but with some key differences.

### Core Concepts:
- **`Game Object`**: A simple container for components, acting as an entity's identifier and position in the world.
- **`Component`**: Provides all functionality (graphics, sound, logic). Defold has a rich set of built-in component types.
- **`Collection`**: A hierarchical structure for grouping game objects. Collections act as scenes or prefabs.
- **Message Passing**: This is a fundamental design choice. Game objects are decoupled and communicate by sending messages to each other rather than through direct function calls. This promotes modularity.

### Property Management:
- **Visual Editor**: Defold has a powerful visual editor for assembling game objects and collections.
- **Lua Scripting**: Game logic is written in Lua. Scripts are a type of component.
- **Lifecycle Functions**: Scripts use predefined functions like `init`, `update`, and `on_message` to interact with the engine and respond to messages.
- **No Inspector Exposure**: Unlike Unity or Godot, there isn't a direct way to expose script variables to the editor for tweaking. Properties are manipulated via script or through messages.

### Architectural Summary:
- **Philosophy**: Provide a complete, high-performance, and collaborative toolset. Decoupling through message passing is a core tenet.
- **Structure**: A component-based system with a strong emphasis on message-based communication, organized within collections.

## 7. LÃ–VE (LÃ–VE2D): The Minimalist Lua Framework

LÃ–VE is a minimalist, free-to-use framework for making 2D games in Lua. It's very similar in spirit to MonoGame and Ebiten.

### Core Concepts:
- **Minimalist Framework**: Provides low-level modules for graphics, audio, input, and physics (`love.graphics`, `love.audio`, etc.). It has no editor.
- **Lua-Driven**: All game logic is written in Lua. The core engine is written in C++ for performance.
- **Callback Structure**: A LÃ–VE game is built around three main callback functions:
    - **`love.load()`**: Called once at the start for setup.
    - **`love.update(dt)`**: Called every frame for game logic.
    - **`love.draw()`**: Called every frame to draw to the screen.

### Property Management:
- **Entirely in Code**: All game state and object properties are managed in Lua.
- **Community Patterns**: While LÃ–VE is unopinionated, common patterns have emerged:
    - **State Machines**: Using tables to represent game states (e.g., main menu, gameplay).
    - **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: Many developers adopt ECS principles for more complex games.

### Architectural Summary:
- **Philosophy**: Provide a simple, fast, and fun framework for making 2D games in Lua. Give the developer freedom.
- **Structure**: A simple callback-based loop. The developer is free to implement any higher-level architecture on top of it.

## 8. PICO-8: The Fantasy Console

PICO-8 is not just a game engine; it's a "fantasy console" designed around the idea that creative limitations can be liberating.

### Core Concepts:
- **Strict Limitations**: PICO-8 enforces artificial hardware constraints:
    - **Display**: 128x128 pixels, 16-color palette.
    - **Code**: Lua, with an 8192 token limit.
    - **Sprites**: A 256-sprite sheet (8x8 pixels each).
    - **Sound**: A 4-channel chip.
    - **Cartridge Size**: 32KB.
- **All-in-One Environment**: It includes built-in editors for code, sprites, maps, sound effects, and music. You can create a full game without leaving the PICO-8 environment.
- **`_init()`, `_update()`, `_draw()`**: The core game loop is defined by these three functions, similar to LÃ–VE. `_update60()` can be used for 60fps updates.

### Property Management:
- **Lua Tables**: Game objects and their properties are almost always managed using Lua tables.
- **Global Namespace**: Due to the small scale of PICO-8 games, it's common to manage state using global variables and tables.
- **Code-Driven**: All logic and property manipulation happens in the code editor.

### Architectural Summary:
- **Philosophy**: Limitations foster creativity. Provide a "cozy design space" for making tiny, expressive games.
- **Structure**: Extremely simple, function-based game loop. Data is typically stored in global tables. The architecture is a direct result of the extreme constraints.
